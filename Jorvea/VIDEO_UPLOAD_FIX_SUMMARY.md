# Video Upload & Playback Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### 1. **Root Cause: Upload ID vs Asset ID Problem**
- **Problem**: MUX returns upload IDs initially, but playback requires proper asset IDs
- **Solution**: Enhanced `mediaUploadService.ts` with polling mechanism to wait for asset ID conversion

### 2. **Enhanced Upload Process**
- **File**: `src/services/mediaUploadService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added polling mechanism (30 attempts over 30 seconds) to wait for asset ID
  - Removed fallback that stored upload IDs in Firebase
  - Added proper error handling with descriptive messages
  - Enhanced progress reporting during polling phase

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **File**: `src/screens/CreateContentScreen.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added upload stage state to show "Uploading..." vs "Processing video..."
  - Fixed import issues and type compatibility
  - Added proper error handling
  - Enhanced progress display with stage information

### 4. **Fixed Type Issues**
- Corrected field names (`userName` ‚Üí `username`, removed `mediaType`, `title`)
- Fixed import statements
- Added missing service imports
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

## How It Works Now üîÑ

1. **Video Upload**: User selects video, uploads to MUX
2. **Polling**: System waits for MUX to convert upload ID to asset ID (up to 30 seconds)
3. **Storage**: Only proper asset IDs are stored in Firebase
4. **Playback**: Videos use correct asset IDs for stream.mux.com URLs

## Technical Details üõ†Ô∏è

### Key Changes in `uploadVideoToMux()`:
```typescript
// Before: Stored upload ID as fallback
return {
  assetId: uploadId, // ‚ùå Wrong!
};

// After: Wait for proper asset ID
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  actualAssetId = await muxService.getAssetIdFromUpload(uploadId);
  if (actualAssetId) {
    return {
      assetId: actualAssetId, // ‚úÖ Correct!
    };
  }
  // Wait and retry...
}
```

### Progress Feedback:
- 0-90%: "Uploading..."
- 90-100%: "Processing video..."

## Testing Status üìä

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: Clean for main files
- ‚úÖ Import resolution: Fixed
- ‚úÖ Type compatibility: Resolved
- üîÑ Runtime testing: Requires Android SDK setup for full test

## Expected Behavior üéØ

1. **Upload Success**: Videos should now store proper asset IDs
2. **Playback**: No more HTTP 400 errors from incorrect URLs
3. **Processing**: Clear feedback during MUX processing phase
4. **Error Handling**: Descriptive messages if processing takes too long

## Remaining Tasks üìù

1. Test with actual video upload in the app
2. Verify MUX dashboard shows matching asset IDs
3. Confirm playback works immediately after upload
4. Test edge cases (slow processing, network issues)

## Files Modified üìÅ

- `src/services/mediaUploadService.ts` - Core upload logic
- `src/screens/CreateContentScreen.tsx` - UI improvements  
- `src/services/contentService.ts` - Fixed syntax errors
- `tsconfig.json` - Excluded backup files from compilation

The video upload and playback system should now work correctly with proper asset ID handling!
